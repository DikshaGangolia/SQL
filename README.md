📚 Project Title: Library Management System – SQL Based

💡 Project Overview:
This is a fully functional Library Management System designed using SQL to efficiently manage books, authors, library members, and book issue/return records. The system simulates a real-world library environment where administrators can track book availability, manage membership, and generate reports related to book circulation.

🔧 Technologies Used:

MySQL (SQL DDL & DML)

ER Diagram

Structured Queries for Reports & Analytics

📊 Key Features:

Add and manage book details, genres, and author information

Member registration and tracking

Book issuing and return tracking with issue/return dates

Query to calculate overdue returns based on time limit

Real-time book availability status

Reports like most borrowed books and active members

📁 Project Deliverables:

create_tables.sql – full schema creation

insert_data.sql – sample data to simulate real environment

queries.sql – useful queries for reporting and tracking

ER Diagram – showing relationships between tables

🧠 What I Learned:

Database normalization and schema design

Writing complex joins and conditional queries

Real-world application of SQL in library environments

Managing relationships using foreign keys

Designing scalable and readable database structures

🎯 This project demonstrates my ability to create structured databases, handle real-time data operations, and generate useful insights through SQL. A great foundation for future integration with frontend or backend systems.
